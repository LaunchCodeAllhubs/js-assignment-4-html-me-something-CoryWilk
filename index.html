            <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Sometime in the year 2020, I found a FaceBook group page that promoted the competitive side of a game
               that I had been playing since 1998. The game was Pokémon&reg;. My experience with 
               competitive side of this game was exactly zero. The group ran a competition in the style of "gyms" that specialized in a specific type. I quickly became
               one of two players that had conquered all of the gyms and began the climb through the championship tournament.
               Conquering this group of players gave me the confidence to dive into the official Pokémon&reg; tournament circuit.
               </p>
               <p class="funParagraph">I knew that I needed an experienced player's wisdom if I was going to do well in a tournament setting. I started looking
               at content creators that were also top level competitors in the game. I finally decided to contact Phillip Wingett, also 
               known as Thatsaplusone, as a coach in the game. He was the perfect mix of affordability, approachability, and long-term 
               experience with the game. After a couple of months of working with him on team-building and gameplay, I felt comfortable
               enough to journey to my first Pokémon&reg; regional tournament.
               </p>
            <h2 id="Indianapolis">Indianapolis, IN 2022</h2>
               <p>My first regional was simultaneously fun and overwhelming. The experience of stepping into a convention center filled
                  with people that shared the same passion for a game was amazing, but I made the mistake of going alone. So in a room
                  of fifteen hundred or so people, I felt small and alone. I was ecstatic to play the game at a highly competitive level.
                  I had never had the pleasure of having so much fun getting completely destroyed in the game by some of the top players in
                  the game. Throughout my journey, I seem to have the luck of always matching against top World's level competitors. This has
                  been both a blessing and a curse.

            <h2 id="Milwaukee">Milwaukee, WI 2022</h2>
               <p>My second regional was a much more interesting one. It was the same format as Indianapolis, but this I had people with me 
                  that I could talk to between matches. My girlfriend, Jasmine, came along with me and my coach Phil was there, competing as well.
                  It was a similar story as Indianapolis. I had the misfortune of matching against some of the best in the game, but had a blast 
                  getting the opportunity to play them. I came closer to beating them in games than I ever had before even though these guys 
                  are at the top of the leaderboards in the game. They have multiple regional wins under their belts, as well as deep runs in the 
                  coveted Worlds Championship Series. We also had the opportunity to explore a lot of the local breweries in Milwaukee,
                  finding my favorite new beer at a place called Mob Craft. It is an orange creamsicle ale with actual dairy in the mix that just 
                  sets it over the top.

            <h2 id="Orlando">Orlando, FL 2023</h2>
               <p>Orlando was a different beast altogether. Through various FaceBook groups, I had become close internet friends with a group of guys
                  from various parts of the U.S. This is where we finally met. It is also where I became a potential threat in the game to high level players.
                  It was a fantastic experience. One of my friends works at Disney and was able to get Jasmine a day pass for free, while I introduced the rest 
                  of the crew to the exhausting thrill ride that is a regional tournament. This was the largest one yet, due to the new games just releasing and 
                  an increase in popularity of the competitive scene. I went undefeated through the majority of the tournament, losing my top cut spot to a player
                  who was top 8 at Worlds before. In a 1000 player tournament, I managed to snag a top 100 spot, my proudest achievement to date.

            <h2 id="Charlotte">Charlotte, NC 2023</h2>
               <p>Charlotte was a disappointing showing competitively for me, but a really fun time otherwise. My coach Phil, stayed with us that weekend.
                  So it was a lot of fun getting to actually hang out with a pioneer in the game who had been around since the inception of competitive Pokémon&reg;
                  and had stuck around through all of the changes throughout the years. A couple more from our friend group was also able to join us which led to an 
                  amazing weekend of just hanging out with people I never expected to actual meet in real life.

            <h2 id="Milwaukee2">Milwaukee, WI 2023</h2>
               <p>This is where my story ends. One rule that I had through all of this was that I would never take the game so seriously that I would allow
                  it to affect my mental and emotional health. This is the one where I got severely unlucky with bad matchups team-wise and matched up, once again, 
                  with insanely good Worlds level players. I hit a bad losing streak early and I could feel myself starting to get visibly upset so I scooped. I went 
                  ahead and dropped from the tournament so that Jasmine and I could have just a nice, relaxing weekend getaway. We were able to hit up some of the local 
                  breweries that we missed last time around. Of course, we also had to go back to Mob Craft to see if they still had the orange creamsicle elixir of the gods.
                  Fortunately, they still sold it so I had to bring some home. Overall, it was a great time exploring the city and trying new foods and drinks.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
               <p>At this point, I believe that I have achieved everything that I have wanted to in this game. I proved that I was competitively capable to hang with
                  guys that have been playing the game much longer than me. It also afforded me the opportunity to meet and make new friends that I would never have 
                  otherwise intereacted with. Traveling was a big part of my early 20's and I am very grateful to be able to do it again on my own terms. Perhaps one day
                  I'll play competitively again, but for now I am very content with my results and the experiences that this game has afforded me.
